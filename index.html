    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a biotechnology post-graduate with a passion for both science and
      technology. Beyond biotech, I have developed an interest in learning web
      development that allows me to blend my analytical mindset with a creative
      approach to technology, opening up exciting possibilities for innovation.
      As I continue to grow in my biotechnology career, I'm also learning to
      build and design websites, bridging the gap between science and digital
      solutions. My journey is a testament to my curiosity and drive to learn
      and adapt in a rapidly evolving world. Whether it's in the lab or behind a
      computer screen, I'm dedicated to making a positive impact through my
      work.
